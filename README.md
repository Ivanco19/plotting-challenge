# plotting-challenge

- In this challenge we are analyzing data for 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. In total 10 different treatments were applied and each mouse received a different one. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured.

- First, we clean data and drop repeated values. Once we got a clean dataset we got statistical information for tumors size, like average, median, standard deviation, etc.
- After that, we started plotting different information using pandas and myplotlib. Bars, pie charts, scatter plots and linear graphs were deployed throughout this challenge. In each chart we filtered first data through groupby method and merge function.
- Finally, we used the IQR method to look for some outliers that could affect our results and analysis with the, and using a scipy library we were able to calculate the linear regression to get a trend on the weight vs tumor size average on the different mice.
